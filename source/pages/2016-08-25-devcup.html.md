Last weekend we joined WebGeek’s annual hackathon called [DevCup](http://devcup.net/). The event was held in Meralco Multi-Purpose Hall, Metro Manila, Philippines in the span of two days. The venue was packed with teams of developers, from students to seasoned veterans. There were also a lot of freebies and (best of all) the food was great.

The theme for this year is **Automate** and we spent most of the first day thinking and experimenting what our meager skills could come up with. One technology that we wanted to play around that goes well with the theme is SMS. Luckily one of the event sponsors, Chikka, gave out free P100 balance for each team to be used in their [SMS API](https://api.chikka.com/).

The first idea we tried was an automated commute helper that gives directions through text (like what [Sakay.ph](http://sakay.ph/) does). (If you want to know, this idea was born out of my teammate’s problem of getting to the venue!) To implement this, we tried using [Google’s Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/). Relative to the other available API’s of Google, this one was simple and easy to use. A `GET` request with the origin and destination and the (optional) mode of transport would yield the steps that you would need to follow to get there. The bulk of the effort would just lie on parsing those steps. Unfortunately, we noticed one big problem with this idea. There are no **jeepney routes** in Google Directions! Since this app was aimed to be used by people with no car (car owners would just use Waze anyway), the jeepney routes was a crucial feature. Because of that, we decided to bail on this idea.

We spent a few more minutes of brainstorming until we decided to, instead, create an automated **Missing Persons Database** called **Sagip**. This app would aim to simplify the process of filing a missing person and the authorities’ process of informing the loved ones of the people found. To describe the flow of the application, for example:

1. Tita Marites would send a text to the app that her son JunJun is missing.
1. JunJun is saved in the database.
1. If the admin (probably the authorities) successfully locates JunJun, there would be a button that automatically informs Tita Marites that JunJun has been found.

The implementation of the web app was pretty straightforward. We used Ruby on Rails for the whole stack. As mentioned above, we also used Chikka API for sending/receiving SMS. We set it up so that when you text a certain number (in this case, 292901818) with a person’s details, it automatically saves that information to the database. Since the reporter’s number is also saved, we just simply implemented a callback that sends a found message to that number in the case that the reported person is found.

The biggest challenge we faced in writing the app revolved around the Chikka API integration. First, we only have P100 allocated to our Chikka account. We had to be extremely careful in spending that balance because we won’t be able to demo the app if it runs out! Second, according to one of the Chikka devs, the app *has* to reply to each received text. If the app fails to reply to 3 consecutive texts from a number, that number gets a 24-hour block in Chikka. Now, I’m not sure why they do this (probably for security reasons?), but this made testing a lot more difficult. For every text that we send, we had to make sure that the app works enough that it replies. If it doesn’t (maybe due to errors), we only get 2 tries to fix it before the number gets blocked. Even though we had a total of 3 phones to work with, it still made every test nerve-wracking.

In spite of those hurdles, we were able to finish the core functionalities of the project within the first day. Thanks to that, my teammates and I had a good night’s sleep. We decided to use the second day for polishing the app and the demo.

Long story short, we didn’t win and rightly so! Compared to the competition’s finalists, what we did was a walk in the park. That 9+ hours of sleep should have been a warning sign! For comparison, the notable finalists were:

1. **Summarizing an article and generating a quiz**. The generated quiz involved only multiple choice fill-in-the-blank questions but the generation of those choices were amazingly smart. The main algorithm for this involved getting sentences from the article, identifying the nouns, then getting similar nouns to serve as the quiz choices.
1. **Generating an emergency map from distress calls**. This project has a mobile component for sending emergency calls and a web component for generating the geological map of those calls. It also looked really professional and clean.
1. (My favorite) **Semantic analysis 2.0**. This app requires inputting a hashtag to determine what people feel towards that tag. It does this by scraping social media posts and performing the analysis on the texts. What made this version 2, however, is that it also scrapes and analyzes the posted images. Personally I don’t have any experience with semantic analysis, but I feel that, by difficulty alone, this project should win.


We didn’t bag any prize but I definitely learned a lot from that event. GDG shared interesting new [technologies](https://developers.google.com/web/) for the web, I got to experience playing with an SMS API, and many ideas were shared and explored that can be used for side projects! For sure, there will be a next time! And we will try our best to win it (I’ll try to sleep less).
